The technical problem is to tell which songs, in a dataset of 200 songs, a spotify user is going
to like. The data set consists not of the songs themselves, but of high-level features
extracted using the web-API from Spotify1. These high-level features describe characteristics such as
the acousticness, danceability, energy, instrumentalness, valence and tempo of each song. To your help, 
you are provided a training dataset with 750 songs, each of which Andreas has labeled
with LIKE or DISLIKE. The column "label" in training_data.csv is encoded as 1 = LIKE and 0 = DISLIKE.

I explored tree-based methods for this problem.
